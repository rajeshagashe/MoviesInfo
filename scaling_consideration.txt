Improvements for scale
- database read write separation.
 DB Write (Main/master) to handle DB writes. 
    That is admin activity of adding or editing or deleting a movie. 
 There will be readonly replicas of the DB which will serve the get movie traffic. 
    We can have multiple replicas and have load balancing between them.
 Limitation: 
    There is a small lag between master and replica data sync.
    This seems acceptable trade off for this system.

- Have a cache on top of the DB. 
 Cache store movies information in key value pair,
 so lookup is faster.

- if search is on random/all keys, we can put our data on elastic search 
 and create appropriate indices so that lookup will be faster.

- If machines/servers are set up in different parts of the world,
 India traffic is served from a machine situated in India. 
 That reduces network latency.
 Configure machines to cache movies that are more popular (looked up more often) 
 in areas of concern.
